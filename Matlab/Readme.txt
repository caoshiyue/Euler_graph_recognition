We use Matlab to recognize a graph, "recognition.m" is souse, "generate_graph.dll" is a dll compiled by Matlab, "MWArray.dll" is a necessary library for type conversion from Matlab to c#.
It dosen't need Matlab run when my program is running, but you need to install Matlab 2016b(or higher version) mcr.
